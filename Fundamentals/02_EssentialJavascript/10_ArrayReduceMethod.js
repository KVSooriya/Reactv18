/* 
What reduce method does and what its used for : The goal of reduce is to reduce basically the entire array to just one value
One of the most common useCases: to add numbers together or basically to perform any mathematical operation with numbers.
The reduce method also takes in a callback function which will be executed for each element of the array. And as a second argument,
it also takes in a starter value for that final value that we want to obtain. Also, the callback function needs two arguments:
the current element and the current value of the accumulator.
